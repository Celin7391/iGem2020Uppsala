Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.294 nm, buffer size 0.094 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.222 nm, buffer size 0.022 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
Calculating fourier grid dimensions for X Y Z
Using a fourier grid of 52x52x52, spacing 0.154 0.154 0.154
This run will generate roughly 184 Mb of data
